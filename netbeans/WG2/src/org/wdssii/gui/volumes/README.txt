A LOT of the code in this folder is branched/copied from WorldWind with modifications, so credit to them should be stated.
This is mostly because the AirSpace stuff in WorldWind is still actively changing, and I want to be able to update the WorldWind library regularly without breaking my volumes.
Eventually this code should shrink/disappear and use most of the WorldWind library as is.

I wrote this a few years ago (as of 2011).  Probably I will try to reduce these classes and integrate more with the actual WorldWind libraries.
